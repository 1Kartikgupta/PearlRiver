# PearlRiver (珠江芯片一号)

This projects covers the 1st LibreSilicon Test Chip.

There is a tradition in the Silicon Foundry business to code name Process Control / Process Evaluation Modules (PCM/PEM) with big rivers. Following that tradition, I like to call the 1st LibreSilicon Test / Evaluation Wafer "Pearl River". The Pearl River (珠江) flows close to LibreSilicons rented 1st Clean Room Facility.
