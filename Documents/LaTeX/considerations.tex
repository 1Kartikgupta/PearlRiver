\section{Considerations}

PearlRiver is the first Testwafer for the LibreSilicon 1 $ \mu m$ Technology.

This Testwafer should contain almost all test structures to evaulate and qualify the technology-depended paramters. So on Wafer we placed structures to measure the sheet-resistance of all Poly- and Metallayer, as well capacitors, NMOS and PMOS transistors, bipolar junction transistors, diodes and flash cells. There are even gate cells like NAND3, NOR3 and some others used for ring oscillators.

The parameter, measured from all test structures are used for the Spice3f and other models.


\subsection{Orientation}

There are to different systems to give orientation while talking about locations on the die. One systems use words like top (= upper side), right, buttion (= lower side) and left. The other systems uses cardinal directions like north, east, south and west to name the same. Both systems are very common, but here we use the cardinal directions, just as convention.

Wafers smaller than 8 inches, or 200 mm, have a flat side to give orientation and encode the crystal structure. Well, we like to call the side South with the notch or the flats.

All machines in the process flow has effects while dealing with the structures on the wafer. For instance etching is slightly more aggressiv on the eastern side of a structure than on the western side. To understand und measure this effects, all structures on the die are placed in a dedicated way. Structures are grouped together in a triangle. This triangle we call quarter, while placed four times on the same die, each rotated 90 degrees.
